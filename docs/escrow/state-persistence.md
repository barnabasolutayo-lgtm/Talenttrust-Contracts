# Storage Layout Reference — TalentTrust Escrow Contract

This document maps the currently implemented `DataKey` storage used by
`contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`. A fuller key-by-key reference, including
declared-but-unused keys, is tracked in
[#342](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/342).

## Live Storage Keys

These participant indexes are **append-only**: every `create_contract` appends the new id to the appropriate index vectors.
The contract list readers (`list_contracts_by_participant`) are therefore consistent with contract creation order.



| Key | Value | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Initialized` | `bool` | `initialize` |
| `Admin` | `Address` | `initialize` |
| `Paused` | `bool` | `pause`, `unpause`, emergency controls |
| `Emergency` | `bool` | emergency controls |
| `Contract(id)` | `EscrowContractData` | create/deposit/release/reputation/cancel |
| `NextContractId` | `u32` | `create_contract` |
| `MilestoneReleased(id, index)` | `bool` | `release_milestone` |
| `ReputationIssued(id)` | `bool` | `issue_reputation` |
| `PendingReputationCredits(address)` | `u32` | final release, `issue_reputation` |
| `Reputation(address)` | `ReputationRecord` | `issue_reputation` |
| `Finalization(id)` | `FinalizationRecord` | `finalize_contract` |
| `ReadinessChecklist` | `ReadinessChecklist` | initialize and emergency controls |
| `ClientContracts(address)` | `Vec<u32>` | create_contract |
| `FreelancerContracts(address)` | `Vec<u32>` | create_contract |

## Declared But Not Live

These keys are declared in `types.rs` but no public entrypoint currently uses
them as a complete feature:

- `MilestoneApprovals`
- `PendingClientMigration`
- `ProtocolFeeBps`
- `AccumulatedProtocolFees`

Protocol fee implementation is tracked in
[#313](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/313) and
[#314](https://github.com/Talenttrust/Talenttrust-Contracts/issues/314).

### 3. Reputation Auditing States
* **`PendingReputation(Address)` / `ReputationIssued(u32)`**
    * **Description:** Bookkeeping indices capturing un-issued tokens and completion certificates for network participants.
    * **Storage Lifespan:** `Persistent`. Preserved explicitly to guarantee deterministic chronological processing when users harvest pending system values.

- Contract ids are monotonically assigned from `NextContractId`.
- Milestone amounts and participant addresses are immutable after creation.
- `total_deposited`, `released_amount`, and `refunded_amount` are checked after
  balance-changing operations.
- A milestone release flag can move from absent/false to true only once.
- Reputation issuance is guarded by `ReputationIssued(contract_id)`.
